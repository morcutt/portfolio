  &lt;h2&gt;Project Background&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;IBM Waston health is a ---- Lorem Ipsum etc&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Cost and Care Insights is a ----To provide trusted quality and cost recommendations to C-Suite Executives in an consolidated view, using data from multiple sources..     C&amp;amp;CI - will use cognitive capabilities to help C-Suite Executives uncover meaningful insights, make decisions based on recommendations, and help them proactively strategize future actions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the next 5 years, the need to integrate and expand Performance Management capabilities across a health system’s enterprise will grow into a $2B-$4B US market&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;Discovery&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Leverage Research's personas from expertinterviews&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;All participants identified common pain point themes as high priorities affecting their users. These painMost participants wanted a more measure centric view.

Finding #2 – HTA Workshop (1)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Most participants wanted a more measure centric view. From the Department dashboard it wasn't apparent to participants which facilities possessed the greatest opportunity for improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Secondary Research&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Research shows users want to see Clinical and Financial data together.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Want predictive analytics&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;Design and Build&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;Working backwards from perfect&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I wanted to first understand the experience the users are going through when using the current application. Collaborating with Product, analytics and developemnt, we created as-is and to be journey maps to see whhat was going on today and where we wanted to go. We came up with a baseline workflow that went across all dashboard senarios =&amp;gt;=&amp;gt;=&amp;gt; Created mental models to help empathize with the users&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It bacame clear that the users were loosing context when trying to drill down into analytics to reveal any correlation. The analytics were not necessarily derivitive of one another which is why the databased and dashboards were set up seperatly. We wanted to make it easier for perople to switch between the relevent topics without conflaiting that the analytics were necessarily derivitive&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;Outcomes&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-4&quot;&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;The Challenge&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Pivot the data not the user I was lucky to be able to work with a robust design research team on this project. They had done some previous analysis on the state of the product and how users were receiving it. There was some common themes about being able to find and discover analytics efficiently. A lot came to to the IA was currently structured around how the data was stored resulting in 10 different dashboards the user had to navigate to follow insights. Additionally users needed the ability to leverage trended data to assess behavior over time to understand the whole story. This was currently hidden and separate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;My Role&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I was the design Lead on the project. My role was to manage all aspects of the design process in collaboration with my business, analytics and development colleagues. I managed and participated in the execution of design research and delivery of all design assets for the project. It was my roll to communicate design requirements to stakeholders and work through any business discovery needs and development limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

There was a lot of feedback coming from customers and users around not understanding how the analytics were calculating the results,. The users were given a final answer and some rules around how it worked but it essentially was a black box to them. A lot of custeomer service calls were taking up resources in house to answer questions around why or why not a analytic did or did not include a patient when they believed it should have. Sometimes the data was not clean on their and and updating their records would fix the problem. What they couldn’t exaclt;y see is what was the specific reason of x to the 10 criteria ion a patient’s record was the reason.

We were not concerned so much with giving away any secret sausse to the analytic as most of the ones were were running were goverments CMS sanctioned. Communicating this was the callenge. We started by having interviews with internal customer service reps who would be responsible for getting this information out to the client. We also interviewed clients themselves on how and why these issues were arising which revealed more concernse with data trust.We consulted orhger stakeholders and architecte and then colaborted with PM and dev to consoder some solutions .
